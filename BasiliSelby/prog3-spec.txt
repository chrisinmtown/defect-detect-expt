              Program 3

A list is defined to be an ordered collection of integer elements
which may have elements annexed and deleted at either end, but not in
the middle. The operations  that  need  to  be  available  are
ADDFIRST,  ADDLAST, DELETEFIRST, DELETELAST, FIRST, ISEMPTY,
LISTLENGTH, REVERSE, and NEWLIST. Each operation is described in
detail below. The lists are to contain up to a maximum of five (5)
elements. If an element is added to the front of a "full" list (one
containlng five elements already), the element at the back of the list
is to be discarded. Elements to be added to the back of a full list
are discarded. Requests to delete elements from empty llsts result in
an empty list, and requests for the first element of an empty list
results in zero (0) being returned. The detalled operation
descriptions are as below:  

ADDFIRST(LIST L, INTEGER I)
    Returns the list L with I as its first element followed by all the
    elements of L.  If L is "full" to begin with, L's last element is
    lost. 
ADDLAST(LIST L, INTEGER I)
    Returns the list with all of the elements of L followed by I.  
    If L is full to begin with, L is returned (l.e., I is ignored).
DELETEFIRST(LIST L)
    Returns the list containing all but the first element of L.  
    If L is empty, then an empty list is returned.
DELETELAST(LIST L)
    Returns the list containing all but the last element of L.  
    If L is empty,  then an empty list is returned.
FIRST(LIST L)
    Returns the first element in L.  
    If L is empty, then it returns zero (0).
ISEMPTY(LIST L)
    Returns one (1) if L is empty, zero (0) otherwise.
LISTLENGTH(LIST L)
    Returns the number of elements in L.  
    An empty list has zero (0) elements.
NEWLIST(LIST L)
    Returns an empty list.
REVERSE(LIST L)
    Returns a list contalnlng the elements of L in reverse order.
