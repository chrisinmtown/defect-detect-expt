\subsection*{Name}

count -- count lines, words, and characters

\subsection*{Usage}

count filename [ filename ... ]

\subsection*{Description}

{\bf count} counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the
named files.  Words are sequences of characters that are separated by
one or more spaces, tabs, or line breaks (carriage return).

If a file supplied as argument does not exist, a corresponding error
message is printed and processing of any other files continues.
If no file is supplied as an argument, {\bf count} reads from the
standard input.

The computed values are given for each file (including the name of the
file) as well as the sum of all values.
If only a single file or if the standard input is processed, then no
sum is printed.
The output is printed in the order lines, words, characters, and
either the file name or the word ``total'' for the sum.
If the standard input is read, the fourth value (name) is not printed.

\subsection*{Options}
None.

\subsection*{Example}
\begin{verbatim}
    % count datei
         84     462    3621 datei
\end{verbatim}
