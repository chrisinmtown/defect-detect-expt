The classification of each fault is given in braces.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Fault in function ``treeprint'', line 25: 
The symbol ``>'' should be ``>=''.

\{Comission, Control\}

Causes failure:
If a boundary value $n$ is given with the ``-m'' argument, 
the value $n + 1$ is used instead of just $n$.


\item Fault in function ``getword'', line 64/77: 
The length of the input is not checked.

\{Omission, Data\}

Causes failure:
The program dumps core if a very long word is read.


\item Fault in function ``main'', line 97 (circa): 
The array ``MapAllowed'' is never initialized.

\{Omission, Initialization\}

Causes failure:  Compiler-dependent; non-alphanumeric symbols could
be mistakenly accepted.


\item Fault in function ``main'', line 101: 
The variable ``Alpha'' is initialized with 0 instead of 1.

\{Comission, Initialization\}

Causes failure:
The argument ``-a'' has no effect.


\item Fault in function ``main'', line 115:
The argument ``-a'' is not documented in the usage message.

\{Omission, Cosmetic\}

Causes failure:
The help message says nothing about the ``-a'' argument.

\end{enumerate}
