\item When did you begin with the exercise in ``code reading''?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} : \rule{7mm}{.5pt} [hour:minute]

\item How much time did you need to construct the abstractions?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} : \rule{7mm}{.5pt} [hours:minutes]

\item How many abstraction levels did you produce?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} [count]

\item Which description method did you choose to represent the
components? [\{informal, functional, Mills' method (only if state
boxes were used)\}] 

\item When did you begin to search for inconsistencies?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} : \rule{7mm}{.5pt} [hour:minute]

\item When did you begin to isolate faults?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} : \rule{7mm}{.5pt} [hour:minute]

\item How much time did you need to isolate faults?
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} : \rule{7mm}{.5pt} [hours:minutes]

\item When did you end the experiment?

\item Would you say that you found all of the faults?
Please give your estimate of the per cent of faults that you found.
\rule{7mm}{.5pt} [per cent]
