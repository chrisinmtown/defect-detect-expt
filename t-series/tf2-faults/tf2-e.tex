The classification of each fault is given in braces.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Fault in line 54: 
The variable ``endingstr'' is used in the ``printf()'' instead of
``startstr''.

\{Comission, Data\}

Causes failure:
Although a non-numeric first argument is recognized as an error, the
corresponding error message shows the second argument.


\item Fault in line 57: 
The variable ``startstr'' is used in the if-condition instead of
``endingstr''.

\{Comission, Data\}

Causes failure:
The program does not recognize a non-numeric second argument as an
error. 


\item Fault in line 88: 
The value of the variable ``nitems'' is set to 2 instead of 1.

\{Comission, Initialization\}

Causes failure:
If the distance between the first and second parameter is evaluated to
zero, then two lines are produced as output although only one was
expected.


\item Fault in line 82--83: 
Treatment of the case ``end < start'' was forgotten.

\{Omission, Computation\}

Causes failure:
No output is produced in the case that the starting value is greater
then the ending value.
